# Predicting Hospital Length of Stay (LOS)

This repository contains code and resources for building a simple, data-driven model to predict patient length of stay (LOS) at New York State hospitals using the SPARCS Inpatient Deidentified Dataset.

## Project Overview

Long hospital stays tie up beds, staff and resources. By predicting how long a patient will stay—based on age, admission type, severity and diagnosis—we can:

Optimize bed allocation before patients even arrive

Inform discharge planning to reduce bottlenecks

Align staffing levels with expected demand

Forecast supply needs (e.g., meals, medications)

This project is designed to be a straightforward starting point: clean the data, explore trends, engineer features, and fit a basic model to estimate LOS.
